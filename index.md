                        <li>To reduce the environmental impact of FOW solutions by reducing the carbon footprint of the construction of the concrete floating platform to 50% compared to a steel platform.</li>
                        <li>To increase social acceptance by contributing to reduce the cost of electricity and the socioeconomic impact of the offshore wind technologies.</li>
                        <li>To improve O&M and platform monitoring by the definition of an interactive holistic predictive model for preventive maintenance and efficient wind farm control to reduce wake effects for floating wind farms.</li>

                    <h2>Principles</h2>
                    
                    <p id="slide5-text">FLAGSHIP Project will achieve its objectives based on the following principles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cost and environmentally effectiveness</li>
                        <li>Maintenance-free concept for floating platform and minimum O&M requirements for other components</li>
                        <li>Maximum efficiency and scalability potential proving a solution for a 10+ MW turbine, establishing the requirements for the scalability for 15-20 MW</li>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    
                    <p>The initiative addresses the natural step that the wind sector must take to achieve economies of scale in floating wind power through better integration along the entire value chain starting with a single FOW solution at unit scale.</p>
                    <p>It will be followed by its industrialisation at wind farm scale for mass production and, finally, the project will ensure the versality and long-term feasibility of the proposed solution by concept scalability and lifetime extension.</p>

                    <p>First...</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>First, the dry dock is planned to be constructed at Aker Solution’s Stord Fabrication Yard, North of Haugesund on the west‐coast of Norway.</p>
                            <p>The project will also build a robust and innovative semi-submersible concrete floating platform based on Olav Olsen’s OO‐Star Wind Floater concept. It includes an easy-to-install anchorage design, innovative mooring designs and configurations, as well as new cable designs with optimized installation and life management procedures. </p>
                        </div>
                    <p>After the lower section is completed...</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>After the lower section is completed, the dry dock will be flooded, and the concrete structure will be towed away.</p>
                            <p>Upper sections of the columns will be constructed with the floater moored to the quayside at Eldøyane, near the dry dock. The water depth (>20m) is sufficient for the later assembly of the tower and turbine.</p>
                        </div>
                    <p>Finally...</p>
                        <div>
                            <p>Finally, the FLAGSHIP demonstration will be located in the Marine Energy Test Centre (MET) in the Norwegian North Sea.</p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <p>Characteristics of the test centre location:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wind speed, 50-yr, 10 min mean gust, SWL + 100 m: 39,5 m/s</li>
                        <li>Wave height, 50 yr: Hs=12,9 m, Tp=16 sec.</li>
                        <li>Current speed, 50 yr: surface 1,62 m/s</li>
                        <li>Distance to shore: Approx. 13 km</li>
                        <li>Seabed: Clay, soft soil (over medium to stiff clay)</li>
                        <li>Water depth: 200 m</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>FLAGSHIP’s demonstration will be the starting point for large-scale 500MW+ commercial floating offshore wind farms of the future. Its location ensures it will also be feasible to deploy the technology in other locations, such as the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean and Baltic seas. </p>
